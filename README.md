```
Arma 3 mission

3rd world mayor/leader:

You are the mayor of a state made up of towns and locations

towns and locations generate tax.

tax < cost to run state. not paying state bills reduces support and ups state costs for next year.

gangs arrive and you must sell locations or even towns to them for a payoff to run the state. but they reduce tax

gang owned towns force support to you.

yanks arrive to deal with drugs and stuff

they start giving you money but is slow at first and depends on you dropping gang support for towns (you may loose some by force)

you selling out to the yanks makes the gangs angry and less likely to deal (eventually wanting to kill you)

towns that have fighting yanks or gang violence lower support

you canâ€™t get caught by the yanks talking to the gangs or they will arrest you

elections come along every so often and you have to either clear gangs fully out or sell towns to gangs to gain enough support to be re-elected.

End game:
Death,
Arrest,
Loose election- Effectively you have to hide or die or be arrested.
Drive the gangs out.
Drive the yanks out (dictator end)
